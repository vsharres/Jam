# Jam

Project Jam is 2D video game where the focus of the game is to create a procedural narrative where the player interacts with NPC's that have beliefs and desires. 
This modeling of beliefs and desires is based on a specific kind of AI architecture called Exclusion Logic. 

This project is been made on C++/Unreal Engine 4. 

The current state of the project is still on a vertical slice stage, where I'm still programming basic functionality.
